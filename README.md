## Pagination _(Group)_ ##
Calling any Group resource endpoint without its following singular noun form endpoint will return a paginated list of available resources for that Group resource. By default, a list "page" will contain up to 10 resources. If you would like to change this just add a 'limit' query parameter to the GET request, e.g. ?limit=20. You can use 'page' to move to the next page, e.g. ?limit=20&page=3.
### Named (endpoint) ###
```GET http://<future-host-name>/api/{group}```

_Note: group is equal to "quotes" in below example output_
```
"results": [
    {
        "id": 101,
        "quote": "Projectiles are bullshit.",
        "daredevil": {

| 1/28/24  | Completed MVP of backend. Attempting to deploy application online through Azure. Having difficulty running it succesfully thought :( | 
| 1/29/24  | Addition of Daredevil Model. Changed Quotes Model to reflect Daredevil (refs) and logic that comes with it. IE deleting one deletes others or id decrement logic. |
| 1/30/24 | Merged endpoints of GET random & specific with query together. Implemented pagination for both Groups/Models. Also wrote documentation for API's public funcitonality/endpoints (ripped tf off from Pok√©API, thank you).
| 1/31/24 | Learned about RESTful APIs. Updated endpoints to match the transparent URL/URI constraints :) |
| 2/8/24 | Spent time re-learning React. Started working on Figma and implementing the design and layout. Hit a stopping point on useFetch which will use my API. Getting closer! |
